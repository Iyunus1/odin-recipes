    <h3><em>Ingredients</em></h3>
    <ul>
        <li>¼ cup unsalted butter</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon garlic powder</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon onion powder</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon chili powder</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon Cajun seasoning</li>
        <li>2 ears fresh corn, sliced into 6 equal-sized rings</li>
        <li>sea salt to taste</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons chopped fresh chives</li>
        <li>¼ cup ranch dressing, or to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h3><strong>Steps</strong></h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Combine butter, chili powder, garlic powder, onion powder, and Cajun seasoning in a microwave-safe dish and cook in the microwave until butter is fully melted, about 1 minute. Remove from microwave and stir.</li>
        <li>Use tongs to dip a corn ring into the spiced butter, making sure to coat it thoroughly in the spices. Transfer to a plate and continue until all of the rings have been dipped. There will be butter remaining.</li>
        <li>Heat an oven-safe skillet over medium heat. Once heated, place corn rings into the skillet, season them individually with sea salt, and let them sizzle away until a nice sear has developed, about 3 minutes. Flip and use a basting brush to brush remaining butter onto the seared sides of the rings. Season again with salt and continue to cook for 2 more minutes.</li>
        <li>Transfer the skillet into the preheated oven and cook for 10 minutes. Carefully flip the rings and cook for 5 more minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove from the oven and transfer to a serving platter. Sprinkle chives over top and serve with ranch dressing, along with corn skewers for picking up individual rings.</li>
    </ol>
